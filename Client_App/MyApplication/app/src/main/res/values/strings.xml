        "Safe Rides is an Associated Students Inc. program that provides free, safe, and confidential rides home to the students, staff, and faculty of Sac State.

The Safe Rides Program is designed to prevent incidents related to drinking and driving that lead to accidents, DUI/DWI arrests, and death. However, Safe Rides is also a safety net. It can be used in many different situations. For instance, Safe Rides can be used to get home from a bad date, a late movie, or a broken down car.

Safe Rides operates from September through May on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. All that is needed is a valid One Card and a call to (916) 278-TAXI (8294)."
